Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your {{ .Chart.Name }} operator is up and running. Here are some important information and next steps to get started:

1. Verify that the operator has been installed successfully:

   kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -l app.kubernetes.io/instance={{ .Release.Name }}

   You should see the {{ .Chart.Name }} operator pod running in the {{ .Release.Namespace }} namespace.

2. Label the namespaces where you want the operator to manage certificates:

   kubectl label namespace <your-target-namespace> nimble.opti.adapter/enabled="true"

3. Create a {{ .Chart.Name }}Config custom resource in any labeled namespace:

   Save the following YAML content to a file named `nimble-opti-adapterconfig.yaml`:

   apiVersion: nimble-opti-adapter.example.com/v1alpha1
   kind: nimble-opti-adapterConfig
   metadata:
     name: example-config
   spec:
     certificateRenewalThreshold: 30
     annotationRemovalDelay: 60

   Apply the configuration using kubectl:

   kubectl apply -f nimble-opti-adapterconfig.yaml -n <your-target-namespace>

4. Monitor the Prometheus metrics exposed by the operator:

   - nimble-opti-adapter_certificate_renewals_total: Total number of certificate renewals
   - nimble-opti-adapter_annotation_updates_duration_seconds: Duration (in seconds) of annotation updates during each renewal
